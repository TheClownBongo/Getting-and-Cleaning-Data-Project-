In the train and test directory, you have 3 files and a directory
- subject_j.txt indicates which subject provided the information, j = train, test 
- y_j.txt gives the label of the activity, j = train, test
- X_j.txt gives the measurements collected, j = train, test
- The directory Inertial Signals has for the x, y, and z coordinates
- The body acceleration signal obtained by substracting the gravity from total acceleration body_acc_i_j.txt, i = x,y,z, j = train, test
- The angular velocity vector measured by gyroscope for each window sample body_gyro_i_j.txt, i=x,y,z, j = train, test
- The acceleration signal from the smart phone accelerometer in standard gravity units total_acc_i_j.txt, i=x,y,z, j = train, test

The following measurements are recorded in time domain
- Body Acceleration in the 3 spatial directions
- Gravity Acceleration in the 3 spatial directions
- Body Acceleration Jerk in the 3 spatial directions
- Body Gyroscope in the 3 spatial directions
- Body Gyroscope Jerk in the 3 spatial directions
- Magnitude of Body Acceleration
- Magnitude of Gravity Acceleration
- Magnitude of Body Acceleration Jerk
- Magnitude of Body Gyrospcope Jerk

After applying a Fast Fourier Transform, one obtains
- Body Acceleration in the 3 spatial directions
- Gravity Acceleration in the 3 spatial directions
- Body Acceleration Jerk in the 3 spatial directions
- Body Gyroscope in the 3 spatial directions
- Body Gyroscope Jerk in the 3 spatial directions
- Magnitude of Body Acceleration
- Magnitude of Gravity Acceleration
- Magnitude of Body Acceleration Jerk
- Magnitude of Body Gyrospcope Jerk
